# Emotional-Rollercoaster
Emotional Rollercoaster was developed as a project for ICHack 2017.

## Inspiration
Emotional Rollercoaster was inspired by puns, stress and a desire to take advantage of Microsoft Cognitive Services. 

## What it does
Emotional Rollercoaster follows a similar concept to Guitar Hero or Dance Dance Revolution but with a twist: Match your emotions with the given picture emotion to move your car forward. The better your match, the further you go! 

## How we built it
On the software side, Emotional Rollercoaster was developed in C# by modifying the sample demonstration of near-real-time analysis on frames taken from a live video stream found here [link](https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-Samples-VideoFrameAnalysis/)

On the hardware side, we reverse-engineered a toy car and created a prototype rollercoaster from it. 

## What's next for Emotional Rollercoaster
Imagine a dynamic theme park, where rides go faster if they detect that you are not scared enough, or a car that detects the emotion of drivers and passengers for a customized commuting experience. The versatility of Microsoft API makes all of this possible.
